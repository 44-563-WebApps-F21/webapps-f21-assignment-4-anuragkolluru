    <p class="speech">You are a coward,
        Take out the knife, get to the Duke’s chamber,
        And bring me back his heart upon the blade.
        When he is dead, then you can talk to me
        Of noble vengeances.</p>

    <p class="speech">Upon thine honour,
        And by the love thou bearest my father’s name,
        Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman,
        That generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord,
        Would have crept at night-time, like a common thief,
        And stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed,
        However he had wronged him: tell me that.</p>

    <p class="speech">You have sworn an oath, see that you keep that oath.
        Boy, do you think I do not know your secret,
        Your traffic with the Duchess?</p>
