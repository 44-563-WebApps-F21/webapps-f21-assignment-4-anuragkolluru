    <p>
        GUIDO<br>

        No!
        God hath no minister but his own hand.
        I will not kill this man.<br>

        MORANZONE><br>

        Why are you here,
        If not to kill him, then?<br>

        GUIDO<br>

        Lord Moranzone,
        I purpose to ascend to the Duke’s chamber,
        And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
        The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
        Then he will know who held him in his power
        And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
        Which I can take.<br>

        MORANZONE<br>

        You will not slay him?<br>

        GUIDO<br>

        No.<br>

        MORANZONE<br>

        Ignoble son of a noble father,
        Who sufferest this man who sold that father
        To live an hour.<br>

        GUIDO<br>

        ’Twas thou that hindered me;
        I would have killed him in the open square,
        The day I saw him first.<br>

        MORANZONE<br>

        It was not yet time;
        Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,
        Thou pratest of forgiveness.<br>

        GUIDO<br>

        No! revenge:
        The right revenge my father’s son should take<br>
