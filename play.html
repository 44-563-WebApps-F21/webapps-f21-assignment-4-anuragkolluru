        gold on it on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
        black is sitting the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
        burning tow thunder and lightning outside the time is night

        <h5>GUIDO</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>No!
            God hath no minister but his own hand.
            I will not kill this man.
        </p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>MORANZONE</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>Why are you here,
            If not to kill him, then?
        </p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>GUIDO</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>Lord Moranzone,
            I purpose to ascend to the Duke’s chamber,
            And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
            The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
            Then he will know who held him in his power
            And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
            Which I can take.
        </p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>MORANZONE</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>You will not slay him?</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>GUIDO</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>No.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>[_Looks out at the city_.]</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>MORANZONE</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>Ignoble son of a noble father,
            Who sufferest this man who sold that father
            To live an hour.
        </p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>GUIDO</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>’Twas thou that hindered me;
            I would have killed him in the open square,
            The day I saw him first.
        </p><br>
        <br>
        <p>[_A groan from the_ DUKE’S _chamber again_.]</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>MORANZONE</h5> :<br>
        <br>

        <p>It was not yet time;
            Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,
            Thou pratest of forgiveness.
        </p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>GUIDO</h5> :<br>
        <br>
        <p>[_confusedly_]</p><br>
        <br>

        <p>No! revenge:
            The right revenge my father’s son should take.
        </p><br>
        <br>
