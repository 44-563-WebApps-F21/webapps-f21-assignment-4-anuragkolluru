        with a portière of crimson velvet with the Duke’s arms embroidered in
        gold on it on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
        black is sitting the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
        burning tow thunder and lightning outside the time is night

        <p class="speech">No!
            God hath no minister but his own hand.
            I will not kill this man.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>

        <p class="speech">Why are you here,
            If not to kill him, then?
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>

        <p class="speech">Lord Moranzone,
            I purpose to ascend to the Duke’s chamber,
            And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
            The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
            Then he will know who held him in his power
            And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
            Which I can take.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5> 

        <p class="speech">You will not slay him?</p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h5> 

        <p class="speech">No.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looks out at the city_.]</p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5> 

        <p class="speech">Ignoble son of a noble father,
            Who sufferest this man who sold that father
            To live an hour.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h5> 

        <p class="speech">’Twas thou that hindered me;
            I would have killed him in the open square,
            The day I saw him first.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_A groan from the_ DUKE’S _chamber again_.]</p>

        <h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5> 

        <p class="speech">It was not yet time;
            Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,
            Thou pratest of forgiveness.
        </p>

        <p class="speech">No! revenge:
            The right revenge my father’s son should take.
